# Simple Storage Smart Contract

## Project Description

The Simple Storage Smart Contract is a comprehensive blockchain-based data storage solution that allows users to store, retrieve, update, and manage key-value pairs on the Ethereum blockchain. This decentralized storage system provides a secure, transparent, and immutable way to store data with advanced features including categorization, versioning, access control, and bulk operations.

The contract serves as a foundational building block for decentralized applications requiring persistent data storage. It demonstrates core blockchain concepts such as state management, event logging, access control, and gas-efficient operations while providing a user-friendly interface for data manipulation.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a robust, scalable, and user-friendly decentralized storage solution that empowers individuals and organizations to store data securely on the blockchain. We aim to:

- Democratize data storage by providing blockchain-based alternatives to centralized systems
- Ensure data permanence and immutability through blockchain technology
- Create transparent and auditable data storage with complete operation history
- Provide a foundation for building complex decentralized applications
- Enable trustless data sharing and collaboration across global networks
- Establish new standards for decentralized data management and access control

## Contract Functions

### Core Storage Functions
- `storeData()` - Store new key-value pair with category
- `updateData()` - Update existing record value
- `getData()` - Retrieve complete record information by ID
- `getDataByKey()` - Get data using unique key identifier
- `deleteData()` - Soft delete/deactivate a record

### Query Functions
- `getUserRecords()` - Get all records created by specific user
- `getRecordsByCategory()` - Get records in specific category
- `getActiveRecords()` - Get all currently active records
- `getAllKeys()` - Get array of all stored keys
- `keyExists()` - Check if key exists and is active

### Utility Functions
- `getTotalRecords()` - Get total number of records
- `getActiveRecordCount()` - Get count of active records
- `getRecordMetadata()` - Get record metadata and history
- `bulkStore()` - Store multiple records in one transaction
- `getContractStats()` - Get comprehensive contract statistics

### Administrative Functions
- `transferOwnership()` - Transfer contract ownership
- `reactivateRecord()` - Reactivate deleted records (owner only)

## Data Structure

### StorageRecord Struct
```solidity
struct StorageRecord {
    uint256 id;          // Unique record identifier
    string key;          // Unique key for the record
    string value;        // Stored data value
    address creator;     // Address of record creator
    uint256 timestamp;   // Last modification timestamp
    bool isActive;       // Record active status
    string category;     // Record category
    uint256 version;     // Version number for updates
}
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Solidity ^0.8.0
- Hardhat or Truffle development environment
- MetaMask or compatible Web3 wallet
- Testnet ETH for deployment and testing

### Installation & Deployment
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd Simple-Storage-Smart-Contract

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Deploy to testnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia

# Verify on Etherscan
npx hardhat verify --network sepolia <CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
```

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Storage Operations
```solidity
// Store data
uint256 recordId = storeData("user123", "John Doe", "users");

// Retrieve data by ID
(uint256 id, string memory key, string memory value, , , , ,) = getData(recordId);

// Retrieve data by key
(string memory value, uint256 id, address creator, uint256 timestamp) = getDataByKey("user123");

// Update data
updateData(recordId, "John Smith");

// Delete data
deleteData(recordId);
```

#### Advanced Operations
```solidity
// Bulk storage
string[] memory keys = ["key1", "key2", "key3"];
string[] memory values = ["value1", "value2", "value3"];
uint256[] memory recordIds = bulkStore(keys, values, "batch");

// Get user's records
uint256[] memory userRecords = getUserRecords(msg.sender);

// Get category records
uint256[] memory categoryRecords = getRecordsByCategory("users");
```

## Security Considerations

- **Access Control**: Only creators and owner can modify records
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated before processing
- **Safe Operations**: Protected against reentrancy and overflow attacks
- **Event Logging**: Complete transparency through event emissions
- **Soft Deletion**: Data is deactivated, not permanently removed

## Gas Optimization

- **Efficient Storage**: Optimized struct packing for minimal gas usage
- **Batch Operations**: Bulk functions to reduce transaction costs
- **Query Optimization**: View functions for gas-free data retrieval
- **Storage Patterns**: Efficient mapping usage for fast lookups

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npx hardhat test

# Run specific test file
npx hardhat test test/SimpleStorage.js

# Run tests with coverage
npx hardhat coverage
```
